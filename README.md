Key Takeaways:
Series: 1D data structure.
DataFrame: 2D data structure.
Read data: pd.read_csv(), pd.read_excel(), etc.
Operations: Indexing, slicing, filtering, grouping, aggregating, sorting.
Missing data: Handled with methods like fillna() and dropna().

You can explore more advanced pandas features, such as merging datasets, time series data, and applying custom functions, as you become more familiar with the library.
